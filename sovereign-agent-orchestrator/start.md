# Starting the project manually

Everything was stopped at the end of the last session (API, frontend dev
server, and `ollama serve`). This is the full sequence to bring it back up
from a cold machine, in order.

## 0. One-time setup (skip if already done)

```bash
cd sovereign-agent-orchestrator

# Backend
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

Backend `.env` — this checkout has no `.env` yet, only `.env.example`. Create
one:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and set, at minimum:

```bash
MODEL_MODE=ollama
DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true
DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<pick-something>
JWT_SECRET=<32+ random characters — dev login 503s below that>
```

(`AUTH_MODE=jwt` and the other `DEV_*` values already default sensibly in
`.env.example`; `MODEL_MODE=fake` is the file's default and needs no model
server at all — see the fake-mode section below if that's all you need.)

⚠️ **Do not set `DATABASE_URL` on its own.** The three RAG tier databases fall
back to it when their own variables are unset:

```python
admin_database_url = os.getenv('ADMIN_DATABASE_URL', os.getenv('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite:///./admin_tier.db'))
```

So setting only `DATABASE_URL` — the obvious move when pointing a local run at
Postgres — silently collapses the control plane and all three tiers into one
database, and every tier can then read every document. `REQUIRE_POSTGRES` does
not catch this, because all four *are* Postgres. Either leave all four unset
(the default gives four distinct SQLite files), or set all four:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=...          # control plane: jobs, files, conversations, audit
ADMIN_DATABASE_URL=...    # RAG tier: admin
HIGHER_DATABASE_URL=...   # RAG tier: higher
LOWER_DATABASE_URL=...    # RAG tier: lower
```

`docker-compose.yml` sets all four explicitly, so this only bites runs outside
Docker. To check what a given `.env` actually resolves to:

```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
.venv/bin/python -c "
from app.config import settings
print('control:', settings.database_url)
for t,u in settings.tier_database_urls.items(): print(f'{t:>7}:', u)
print('distinct:', len({settings.database_url, *settings.tier_database_urls.values()}))"
```

Expect `distinct: 4`.

Frontend `.env` (already present in this checkout, `frontend/.env`):

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

## 1. Start Ollama

```bash
OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0 OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 \
OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1 ollama serve
```

Run this in its own terminal tab (it stays in the foreground), or backgrounded:

```bash
OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0 OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 \
OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1 nohup ollama serve > /tmp/ollama.log 2>&1 &
```

Confirm the models used by `.env.example`'s recommended set are pulled:

```bash
ollama list
```

Expect `qwen3.6:27b`, `qwen3-vl:8b`, `bge-m3`. If missing:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.6:27b   # reasoner + coder + calc + docs + general (~17 GB)
ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b   # vision: scans, screenshots, drawings, handwriting (~6 GB)
ollama pull bge-m3        # embeddings, multilingual (~1.2 GB)
```

Real-model runs are memory-heavy: `qwen3.6:27b` is ~17.8 GB resident, and the
first prompt after startup pays the full load before it generates anything.
It runs fine on this machine at the settings above. An earlier freeze was
memory pressure with many other apps open rather than the model itself — if
you're running something larger, keep an eye on `Activity Monitor` → wired
memory, or `sysctl vm.swapusage`.

Use `MODEL_MODE=fake` (below) for quick UI checks that don't need real model
output.

## 2. Start the backend API

⚠️ **The app does not auto-load `.env`** — there's no `python-dotenv` wired
in on this branch, so a `.env` file sitting on disk is silently ignored
unless you actually export its values into the shell first. From
`sovereign-agent-orchestrator/`:

```bash
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
```

(`set -a` / `set +a` makes every variable `source`d in between exported
automatically — plain `source .env` alone will not pass them to uvicorn.)

Verify:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/ready | python3 -m json.tool
```

`/ready` reports the active model, embedding model, and vision model, and
whether each backing service is actually reachable.

### Fake mode (no Ollama needed)

For quick dashboard/UI checks without a model server, set `MODEL_MODE=fake`
in `.env` (its default) instead of `ollama`, and skip step 1 entirely — the
whole pipeline runs on deterministic stub responses.

## 3. Start the frontend

In a separate terminal, from `sovereign-agent-orchestrator/frontend/`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite serves on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## 4. Open and log in

Go to **http://localhost:5173**. On the login screen:

- **Test account**: `Admin` (or `Higher`/`Lower`)
- **Password**: whatever you set as `DEV_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (etc.) in `.env`

This dev-login screen only works while `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` — it's not
present/usable in a production deployment.

### Watching a run

Send a prompt from **Intelligence Feed**. The assistant turn renders a live
six-stage pipeline — task received → model selection → execution plan → tool
execution → verification → delivery — driven by the job's SSE event stream.
Completed stages tick and fill the connector; the active one pulses.

Each stage shows what the backend actually reported: the routed model with its
task type, confidence and reason; the planned steps and their tools; each tool
call marked `ok` / `failed` / `denied by policy` as it finishes; the
verification checklist; and the artifacts produced. The raw event log sits
collapsed underneath.

Note on modes: in `MODEL_MODE=fake` a job finishes in well under a second, so
the pipeline jumps straight to its completed state. To actually watch it
advance stage by stage, run with `MODEL_MODE=ollama` — the first prompt will
also sit on *Model Selection* for a while as the 27B loads into memory.

## Stopping everything

```bash
pkill -f "uvicorn app.main:app"
pkill -f "node .*/vite"
pkill -f "ollama serve"
```

Stopping `ollama serve` also unloads the model and returns its ~17.8 GB.

(`pkill -f "vite --host"` only matches if you started it with an explicit
`--host` flag — plain `npm run dev` won't have that in its command line, so
match on the vite binary path instead.)

Or just `Ctrl+C` each foreground terminal if you didn't background them.

## Quick reference — what's running, where

| Service | Command | Port | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ollama | `ollama serve` | 11434 | nothing |
| Backend API | `uvicorn app.main:app` | 8080 | Ollama (unless `MODEL_MODE=fake`) |
| Frontend | `npm run dev` (vite) | 5173 | Backend API |

Start in that order; stop in reverse (or just `pkill` all three, order
doesn't matter there).
